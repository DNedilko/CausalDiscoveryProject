\section{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Are the discovered causal paths meaningful and interpretable?
    \item What are the limitations of this approach given the observational nature of HBSC?
    \item Are the assumptions of the FCI algorithm likely to hold in this case?
    \item Could latent variables (e.g., personality traits) explain some of the results?
\end{itemize}
