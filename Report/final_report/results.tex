\subsection{Interpretation}
[Explain notable relationships (e.g., parental communication $\rightarrow$ peer trust $\rightarrow$ life satisfaction). Which arrows suggest direct influence? Where are bidirected edges?]

\subsection{Sensitivity to Parameters}
[Optionally, mention results under different $\alpha$ values, sample sizes, or independence tests.]
