\section{Data Description and Preparation}

\subsection{Source, Context. and variable Selection}
We use the 2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) dataset, a cross-national survey supported by the WHO, which gathers health-related information from adolescents aged 11, 13, and 15. This dataset encompasses over 120 variables and covers aspects such as well-being, social relationships, behaviours, and demographic characteristics across more than 40 countries. The dataset comprises 120 variables.

These variables offer in-depth insights into individuals' health, well-being, and lifestyles. Furthermore, they include indicators related to family structure, affluence, and socio-economic status. For our research, the most critical variables are those measuring the frequency of bullying and how well individuals perceive their social integration within groups, including school peers and friends, the expression of their emotions, and their overall life satisfaction(See Table \ref{tab:hbsc_variables_grouped}  - key categories are in bold).

% In the following sections, we select only a subset that brings the most information to our analysis.
The dataset includes two computed indicators:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{IRFAS} – Family Affluence Scale III (continuous score)
 \item \texttt{IRRELFAS} – Relative family affluence category (categorical: low, medium, high)
\end{itemize}
 
Variables such as IRFAS and IRRELFAS\_LMH are determined by a set of indicators that reflect family affluence. Table \ref{tab:FAS_variables} outlines the variables used to calculate the Family Affluence Scale III (FAS III). Despite a noticeable gap of nearly 6 points in the average weighted FAS III score for Luxembourg and Armenia (Figure \ref{fig:IRFAS_histogram}), the weighted mode of Relative FAS remains consistent across all regions at a medium level. This prompted us to investigate the relationship between the continuous and categorical versions of the score. Publications[\cite{McCormack2011}] that FAS is calculated using the following scheme: Responses to individual items were summed to derive a total FAS score and then categorized into three groups (low FAS score = 0 to 4; medium FAS score = 5 or 6; or high FAS score = 7 or 8). However, as one can observe in the table \ref{table IRFAS_IRRELFAS_uniq}, it does not accurately reflect the real data setup. Therefore, we chose to disregard the categorical version of the score and treated the continuous score as a categorical value, as it is an integer that varies from 0 to 13. The value is set to None if a respondent has not answered any of the component questions (Table \ref{tab:FAS_variables}). We deem FAS III important for our further analysis as it reflects the socio-economic background of an individual.

As a part of this report. We have decided to focus on Ukraine data, denoted as region UA in the dataset, or country number 804000. This decision is informed by personal experience and cultural context when interpreting the results of Causal Discovery algorithms.

\subsection{Missing Data}
In the appendix, the number of missing values, coded as sysmiss and represented as 'Nones' in the dataset is shown. Besides that, there are also more types of missingness observed in data, such as "Missing due to skip pattern"(99) or "Missing due to inconsistent answer"(-99).

\subsection{Data Issues and Preprocessing}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Missing data}: [How you handled NA values - deletion, imputation, etc.]
  \item \textbf{Data types}: [How categorical variables were encoded - label encoding, discretization]
  \item \textbf{Sample size}: [Number of observations after cleaning]
