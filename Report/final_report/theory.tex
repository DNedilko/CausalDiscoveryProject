\section{Theory}

\subsection{Algorithm Description}
[Describe the FCI algorithm: inputs, outputs (PAG), and how it works using conditional independence tests.]

\subsection{Assumptions}
[Explain assumptions like causal sufficiency (not required for FCI), faithfulness, and correctness of the conditional independence tests.]

\subsection{Advantages and Limitations}
[Discuss strengths (e.g., handles latent confounding) and challenges (e.g., complexity, sensitivity to CI test errors).]

\subsection{Graph Type}
[Explain that FCI estimates a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG), allowing for bi-directed and circle-ended edges to account for hidden variables.]
